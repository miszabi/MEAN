Simple private blog,
only authenticated users can view, add, update or delete commments blog articles.

This is a private blog. Only with login can be access resources.
Why? Because I only store personal things like links, articles wich maybe only for me are usefull.

1. Create a new article
2. Edit an existent article :  add an edit button -  the link from title should be used to navigate to full article
3. Comment an existing article - This feature is working now but should be move ... read more
4. Poll the existing article - is this usefull or not ....
5. Logging
6. Make a pretty design - mobile?
7. How many times viewed
8. Only list page load from db only fields which is showed on the UI. Description should be loaded only one part from it.
    Maybe I can save as liste below:
            1: title
            2: short description - which is composed the first 200 characters from article. Find a way to split in a userfriendly way.
            3: when logged in user open article for edit load the all description, images.
9. Make possible to upload images files
10. Find a code formatter plugin.
